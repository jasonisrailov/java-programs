# java-programs
This repository holds the practice programs I learn Java with in my AP Computer Sceince A course in high school in 2017/2018.

The textbook I read to learn Java was *Java Software Solutions for AP Computer Science* by Cara Cocking, John Lewis, and William Loftus.

## AP Computer Science A
AP Comp Sci was my third computer science class in high school. It helped me prepare for the AP exam and for my computer science courses at Michigan State University. It reinforced my love for computer science and aspirations to be a software engineer.
