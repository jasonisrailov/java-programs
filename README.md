# java-programs
This repository holds the practice programs I used to learned Java with in my AP Computer Sceince A course in high school in 2017/2018.

The textbook I read to learn Java was *Java Software Solutions for AP Computer Science* by Cara Cocking, John Lewis, and William Loftus.

## AP Computer Science A
AP Comp Sci was my third computer science class in high school. It helped me prepare for the AP exam and for my computer science courses at Michigan State University. It reinforced my love for computer science and aspirations to be a software engineer.

### Projects
Below are a list of projects I completed in the course in order from least complex to most complex:
1. Shower Water Calculator
2. Credit Card Identifier
3. Slot Machine
4. Boxcars
5. Craps
6. Blackjack


### Important Concepts Learned:
* Fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
* Data types and variables such as int, double, and boolean, as well as reference data types such as arrays and objects.
* Control structures such as if statements, loops (for, while, do-while), and switch statements. 
* Methods
* Arrays which are fixed-size collections of elements
* ArrayLists which are dynamic-size collections of elements
* Inheritance and polymorphism
* Exception handling
* Input/output (I/O) such as reading from and writing to files and using standard input/output streams for console input/output
* Recursion
* Software development principles such as modular programming, debugging techniques, testing strategies, and code documentation. I also learned to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code, and how to follow best practices in software development using Java.
