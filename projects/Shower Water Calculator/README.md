# Shower Water Calculator
The Program 1 project for APCS  was to create a calculator to determine the amount of water you are using in a given time showering. 

## Propgram Description
Suffice it to say that the longer you shower, the more water you use. But just how much? Even if you have a "low-flow" showerhead, odds are your shower spits out 1.5 gallons of water per minute. A gallon, meanwhile, is 128 ounces, and so that shower spits out 1.5 ร 128 = 192 ounces of water per minute. A typical bottle of water (that you might have for a drink, not a shower), meanwhile, might be 16 ounces. So taking a 1-minute shower is using 192 รท 16 = 12 bottles of water. Talking (more realistically, perhaps!) a 10-minute shower, then, is like using 120 bottles of water. That's a lot of water! Of course, bottled water itself is wasteful; best to use reusable containers when you can. But it does put into perspective what's being spent in a
shower!

## Program Prompt
Write a program that prompts the user for the length of his or her shower in minutes (as a positive integer) and then prints the equivalent number of bottles of water (as an integer).
Assume that the user inputs a positive integer.
