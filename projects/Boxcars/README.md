# Boxcars Dice Game
The Program 5 project for APCS  was to create a Boxcars Dice Game program.

### Description
In this program, it will simulate a dice game. It will contain two different classes, PairOfDice and a client program called BoxCars. In this game, the the user will choose how many times they would like to roll the dice. The program will randomly roll dice and print the BoxCar numbers 6. It will then sum up the total number of BoxCars with the amount of rolls chosen. Boxcars is the outcome of rolling the dice in a game of craps and getting a 6 on each die.

### Algorithm
1. First, the program asks you how many times you would like to roll.
2. The program generates two random dice that each have die values from one to six.
3. The program only prints the BoxCars that are shown each having the value of 6 for a random roll of die one and die two.
4. The program keeps track of the number of BoxCars by adding one each time to a counter.
5. Finally, the program prints the counter which is the total number of BoxCars.
