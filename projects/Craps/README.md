# Craps
The Program 8 project for APCS  was to create a Craps game program with a pair of dice.


The program will play a game of Craps with you. Use your *PairOfDice* class and create two more classes. One class, *Play*, with be the main one that just plays the game. The third class, *Craps*, will be the whole game. You will be given $500 to begin with. Two dice will be thrown, if the sum of the two dice is equal to 7 or 11 on the first roll, the player wins. If the sum of the dice are equal to 2, 3, or 12 on the first toss, the house wins (these numbers are call the "craps"). If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 for the first toss, the sum rolled becomes the players "point". To win the game, you must roll your "point" again before you roll a sum of 7, in which case the house wins.
If you win, your bet doubles.
